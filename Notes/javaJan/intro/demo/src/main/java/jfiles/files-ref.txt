Files

filereader + buffered reader

filereader
- reads directly from the character stream from filereader
- reads a file as chars
- inefficient for larger Files

buffered reader
- wraps around another reader 
- efficient for large amounts of data as is buffered
- gives us commands like readline(), writeline() etc.
